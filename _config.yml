Hi, my name is Chris. I received my double B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from Delaware State University. Currently, I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago, working with Professor <a href="http://www.cs.uic.edu/~elena">Elena Zheleva</a>. Currently, my main focus is in the realm of causal inference, particularly using machine learning for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects.
