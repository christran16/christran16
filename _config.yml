			Hi, my name is Chris. I received my double B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from Delaware State University. Currently, I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago, working with Professor <a href="http://www.cs.uic.edu/~elena">Elena Zheleva</a>.
			Currently, my main focus is in the realm of causal inference, particularly using machine learning for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects.
			I'm also interested in applying causal inference and machine learning for applications to social science, privacy, social networks.
